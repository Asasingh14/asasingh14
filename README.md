## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Abhipob Sethi, also known as Asa or **`d4rkw3bd31ty`**.

I specialize in **security-conscious development**, blending offensive security with automation. From breaking into boxes to building CLI-first tools, I’m driven by curiosity and clean execution.

In my free time, you’ll often catch me:
- 🏊 Swimming laps to clear my head  
- 📸 Capturing moments through street and landscape photography  
- 🎮 Modding games or exploring obscure APIs  
- 🎧 Zoning out to code with **Punjabi music** on loop  
- 📱 Learning **Flutter** to bridge backend logic with mobile UIs  

I’m also actively working toward certs like **PJPT** and **AWS Solutions Architect** to sharpen both offensive and cloud-native skill sets.
